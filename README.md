### History

From an unknown galaxy, Galushi, a tiny Alien, arrives on planet earth.
in a very particular helium-powered ship, which shoots a red laser almost
imperceptible to the human eye.

Galushi has had a trauma since childhood, and escaped from his planet for the sole purpose of exterminate all helium balloons coming from planet earth.
Your mission is to destroy all the balloons, and maintain a sufficient helium level in your ship to keep shooting with your laser.
